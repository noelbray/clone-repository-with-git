Remote Branches: 

Remote References:

- references (pointers) in your remote repositories, including branches, tags, and so on.

Get Full List Of Remote Referencdes Explicitly: 

git ls-remote <remote>

or 

git remote show <remote> 

git remote show <remote>:

seems to be a more readible format. 

Remote-tracking Branches: 

- references to the state of remote branches. 

- unmoveable local references

- git moves them for you during network communication for accurate state representation of remote Repository

- like bookmarks that remind you of where your remote repositories where the last time you connected to them 

- take names from <remote>/<branch>

Upon Cloning, You Can Change The Default Master Branch Name: 

git clone -o <new-name> <repo>

example: 

git clone -o Stable-main <repository-url-location>
