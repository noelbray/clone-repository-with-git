another way of transferring data over a network(other than HTTP, SSH, etc.)

If you can't connect to the network, server, or shared repository, you can use bundle to get the data, you last commits, to your team-mates.

git bundle command: 

- bundles all data into a single file. 

- will package up everything that "git push" send to the server into a binary file that can be emailed or put on a flash drive and then unbundle into another repository

git bundle create <bundle-filename>.bundle HEAD <branch-name>

git bundle create repo.bundle HEAD master

- in repo.bundle is all the data needed to recreate the repository's master branch

-- in order for someone to make a clone of the bundle/repo, HEAD has to be included

Clone From Binary File, Bundle: 

- git clone rep.bundle repo

- if HEAD references aren't included, you have to use: 

-- -b <branchName-you-want-to-checkout>:

--- git clone repo.bundle repo -b master

Determine The Range of Commits to be Included In The Bundle: 

- bundle everything

- or bundle up the difference - the commits you made locally that the server/person doesn't have 

- Test to see which commits haven't been added to origin/master..master or master ^origin/master

- Run a test to see your last commits: 

-- git log --oneline master ^origin/master

-- this will show all the new commits that haven't been pushed to the server: origin/master

-- if your remote is up-to-date with master, nothing will be shown.

-- Once you know which commits haven't been pushed to the oring/master-main, server, you: 

After getting a list of commits you haven't pushed to the server, 
you can bundle them up: 

- git bundle create <bundle-name-such-as-commits>.bundle <branch-name> ^<beginning-commit-sha-1-for-the-range> 

- git bundle create commits.bundle main ^p39781

-- now commits.bundle is in your directory

--- it can be sent to over email or by flashdrive, usb drive.

Expecting Bundles: 

- git bundle verfiy ../commits.bundle

-- if the git verfication process doesn't say "okay" at the end, you can't import it. 

- Valid, Verified Bundle's Data can be successfully "fetched"

- See Branches Before Fetching:

-- git bundle list-heads ../commits.bundle

-- verify subcommand also tells you the heads as well. 

--- you want to see what can be pulled in. 

-- git fetch ../commits.bundle master:<branch-name-to-import-to>

-- git fetch ../commits.bundle master: other-master

To see What You've Imported: 

-- git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all
