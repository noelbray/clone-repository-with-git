Branching And Merging Workflow - Real World Example

1. Do some work on a website.

2. Create a branch for a new user story you're working on. 

3. Do some work in that branch

But, you receive a call that another issue is critical and you need a 'hotfix'; Now do:

1. Switch to your production branch

2. Create a branch to add the hotfix.

3. After it's tested, merge the hotfix branch, and push to production.

4. Switch back to your original user story and continue working.


Companies Have Issue-Tracking System: 

iss will be short for issue followed by -<number> to indicate the issue number the branch is dealing with, resolving:

Create A Branch and Simultaneously Switch To It: 

git switch -b <new-branch-name>

git switch -b iss-53
