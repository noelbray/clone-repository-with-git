Branching And Merging Workflow - Real World Example

1. Do some work on a website.

2. Create a branch for a new user story you're working on. 

3. Do some work in that branch

But, you receive a call that another issue is critical and you need a 'hotfix'; Now do:

1. Switch to your production branch

2. Create a branch to add the hotfix.

3. After it's tested, merge the hotfix branch, and push to production.

4. Switch back to your original user story and continue working.


Companies Have Issue-Tracking System: 

iss will be short for issue followed by -<number> to indicate the issue number the branch is dealing with, resolving:

Create A Branch and Simultaneously Switch To It: 

git switch -b <new-branch-name>

git switch -b iss-53

"If your working directory or staging area has uncommited changes that conflict with the branch you're checking out, Git won't let you switch branches."

When you switch branches, 

- the Working Directory is set back to the way it was before the new branch or any branch was created or edited. 

- the Working Directory will look like the last commit in it.

hotfix-branch-for-main website was created:

- hotfix issue has been resolved and tested. 

- 'Fixed broken email address' and 'broken footer'

- Commit: 'Hotfix Issue Has Been Fixed and Tested; Ready To Merge'

Fast-forward Merge: 

If a commit in a new branch is immediately after a commit on the main branch, Git will just move the HEAD pointer to the commit that is ahead on the new branch. 

If No Divergent Work on a branch, Git Just moves the pointer (HEAD) to the commit of the branch that was merged in. 

Now you can Delete Hotfix Branch the hotfix branch, in my case, hotfix-branch-for-main:

- you can delete the hotfix branch because you no longer need it since it is merged into main, master and the master, main branch points to the same place, commit of the hotfix branch. 

Delete Branch

git branch -d <branchname>

git branch -d hotfix-branch-for-main
