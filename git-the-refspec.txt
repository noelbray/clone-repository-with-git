[remote "origin"] (name of the remote origin)
    url = https://github.com/yourname/repositoryname (url of the remote repository)
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/* (refspec)

refspec format:

- 1st: optional +

-- + tells git to update the reference even if it isn't a fast-forward

- 2nd: <src>:<dst>

-- src is the pattern for references on the remote side

-- dst is where those references will be tracked locally.

You can access the log of the master, main branch locally:

- git log origin/master

- git log remotes/origin/master

- git log refs/remotes/origin/master

Pull Down Just The Master, Main Branch From The Server

- change the refspec:

-- fetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master

Pull Master Branch On Remote Down to origin/master:

- git fetch origin master:refs/remotes/origin/mymaster

Specify Multiple refspecs:

- git fetch origin master:refs/remotres/origin/mymaster \ topic:refs/remotes/origin/topic

- + can overide a rejection caused by it not being listed as a fast-forward reference. 

- You Can Specify Multiple Refspecs for fetching in your configuration file

- partial globs can be used

Namespaces (directories), namespace references:

- have more structure and do the same as refspec

Pushing Refspecs:

- git push origin master:refs/heads/qa/master

- push refspec can be added to the config file to enable them to be automatically pushed:

[remote "origin"]
    url = https://github.com/yourname/simplegit-progit
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
    push = refs/heads/master:refs/heads/qa/master

- running "git push origin" will push the local master branch to the remote qa/master branch by default. 

- Refspec canNot fetch from onen repo and push to another one

Deleting References: 

- use refspec to delete references from the remote server by running:

- git push <remote-server-url> <src>:<dst>

- ex: git push origin :topic

-- since there is <nothing-here>:topic

--- it makes the topic branch on the remote nothing, effectively deleting it. 

- Newer Delete Syntax:

-- git push <remote-server-url-or-shortname> --delete <branch-name>

-- ex: git push origin --delete topic
