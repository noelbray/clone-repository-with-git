"Branching means you diverge from teh main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line."

"Git encourages workflows that branch and merge often, even multiple times in a day."

Git Stores Data: 

- in a series of snapshots

After commit, git stores pointer to snapshot in an object, pointers to the commit(s) that were before this comit (its parent or parents):

- zero parents for initial commit

- one parent for a normal commit

- multiple parents for a commit that results from a merge of two or more branches

Example:

Stage 3 files: 

git add README test.rb License
