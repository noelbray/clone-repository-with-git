- Do Not rename branches that are still in use by other collaborators. 

- Do Not rename the master, main, or any similar important, core branch.

change bad-branch-name to better-branch-name and keep its history, commits:

Rename Branch Locally: 

git branch --move bad-branch-name better-branch-name

Push better-branch-name to Remote (Github or some other remote) 

- if you have already pushed the branch to the remote:

git branch --set-upstream origin better-branch-name

which will automatically 

- if you have not pushed the branch yet, just run: 

git branch -u origin better-branch-name

-u is short for --set-upstream

To Delete The Old Branch From The Remote That Now Has The Newly Renamed Old Branch Name: 

git push origin --delete bad-branch-name
