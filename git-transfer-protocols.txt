2 Ways to Transfer Data:

- 1. "dumb" protocol

- 2. "smart" protocol

Dumb Protocol:

- for repositories that are "read-only" over HTTP

- requires no git-specific code on the server side during the transport process. 

- the fetch process: 

-- HTTP GET request

-- client can asusme layout of the git repo on the server

- it's rarely used, it's difficult to secure or make private

Smart Protocol:

- simple but inefficient

- can't handle writing of data from client to the server. 

- more common for transferring data

- requiresa process on the remote end that is intelligent about Git 

-- has to be able to read local data

-- figure out what the client has and needs,

-- be able to generate a custom packfile for it.
