Git is a content-addressable filesystem.

- git is a simple key-value data store

-- reminds me of the object in Javascript which contains key:value pairs

- any kind of content can be inserted in git

- git gives you the key which you use to retrieve the content, value

3 Main Git Objects: 

- the blog
- the tree
- the commit the blob

-- they are stored as separate files in your .git/objects directory

- blob object can be almost anything, string, binary large object, etc.
