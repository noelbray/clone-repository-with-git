You must be on the branch that you want the content merged to.

Use

git status

to see if the Github repository's master, main is ahead of your local main, master branch.

If it is, then do:

git fetch

After that, do:

git merge origin/main

or

git merge origin/master

or git merge origin/<branchname>

Great repository names are short and memorable.
