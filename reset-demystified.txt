Git Manages 3 Different Trees(collection of files)

Trees:

1. HEAD: Last, current commit snapshot, next parent

2. Index: proposed next commit snapshot

3. Working Directory: Sandbox


The HEAD: 

- current branch reference

- pointer to last commit made

- HEAD will be parent of the next new commit, it's always the parent of the current commit.

- HEAD is a snapshot of "your last commit" on that branch

- git cat-file -p HEAD

-- shows directory listing and SHA-1 checksums for each file in the HEAD snapshot

-- shows where the HEAD is pointing to
