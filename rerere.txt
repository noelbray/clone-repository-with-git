Rerere = Reuse Recorded Resolution

- it remembers the way you resolved a "hunk conflict"

-- if it sees a similar conflict, it resolves it automatically

Use Rerere For

- to make sure a long-lived topic branch ultimately merge cleanly, 

-- to keep from having a but of merge commits in you history

Rerere Can Automatically

- attempt occasional merge

- resolve conflicts, 

- then back out of the merge. 

-- this should make the final merge easier

- keep a branch rebased

Rerere Can

- merge many changing "topic branches" together into a testable head 

-- if the test fails, rewinding the merge and redoing them withotu the topic branch that made the fail

Enable rerere functionality:

- git config --global rerere.enabled true

- or create this directory in a specific repository:

-- .git/rr-cache
