repo.rb blob object

to get the size of an object:

- git cat-file -s <commit-sha-1-you-want-info-on>

Loose object: 

- the initial format in which Git saves objects

Packfile: 

- git packs up several "loose" objects into a single binary file

- saves space

- more efficient

- git makes packfiles when there are too many "loose" objects 

- Dangling:

-- blobs that aren't pointed to by any commit

-- are not picked up by a new packfile that is created with: 

--- git gc

- a packfile 

-- is a single file that contains the contents of all the objects that were removed from your filesystem.

- a packfile index

-- is a file that contains offsets into that packfile so you can quickly seek to a specific object. 

- git verify-pack <file-url-with-sha-1> 

-- plumming-command allows you to see what was packed up, in the packfile

Git will automatically repack, create packfiles, here and there.

You can manually repack, create packfiles, at any time by running "git gc" by hand.
