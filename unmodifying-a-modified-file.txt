You can do this, yes you can. Keep going.

Unmodify this file. I don't want to keep my changes to this file. 

revert it back to here.

I already reverted this file back to line 5, 
but I write this new message here to reinforce how I did it:

to disrecard changes to the "working directory":

git restore <filename> 

will restore an unstaged file to its previous state.

You can also use:

git checkout -- <filename>
